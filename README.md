# 🌍 Iraq Air Quality Monitoring Radar (Sentinel-5P)

 Project Overview
An advanced environmental monitoring system developed using **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** to track and analyze atmospheric pollutants across Iraq. This project leverages **Sentinel-5P** satellite data to provide real-time insights into air quality and greenhouse gas concentrations.

---

Monitored Pollutants & Safety Limits
The radar automatically calculates and compares the following gases against international environmental standards:
* **NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide):** Monitoring industrial emissions and urban traffic.
* **SO2 (Sulphur Dioxide):** Tracking power plants and refinery outputs.
* **CO (Carbon Monoxide):** Identifying combustion-related pollution.
* **CH4 & CO2:** Analyzing greenhouse gas trends and climate impact.
* **O3 (Ozone):** Evaluating urban air quality and smog levels.

Key Features
* **Automated Dashboard:** Generates a real-time table comparing local data with global safety limits.
* **Dynamic Visualization:** Color-coded status (🟢 Safe, 🟡 Warning, 🔴 Danger) based on pollutant concentrations.
* **Interactive Mapping:** High-resolution heatmaps that can be clipped to any specific region or province in Iraq.
