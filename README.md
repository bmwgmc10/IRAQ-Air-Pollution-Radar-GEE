# Iraq Air Quality Monitoring Radar (Sentinel-5P)

 Project Overview
This tool is designed to monitor and analyze air pollution across Iraq using **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** and **Sentinel-5P** satellite data. It provides an automated environmental assessment for researchers and decision-makers.

---

 Monitored Pollutants
The system analyzes the concentration of critical gases:
* **NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide):** Monitoring industrial and urban traffic emissions.
* **SO2 (Sulphur Dioxide):** Detecting emissions from power plants and oil refineries.
* **CO & CO2:** Analyzing combustion levels and greenhouse gas trends.
* **CH4 (Methane):** Tracking environmental leaks and agricultural impact.

---
 Key Features
* **Automated Dashboard:** Instant comparison against international safety limits.
* **Smart Visualization:** Color-coded results (🟢 Safe, 🟡 Warning, 🔴 Danger).
* **High-Resolution Mapping:** Dynamic heatmaps for identifying pollution hotspots.
